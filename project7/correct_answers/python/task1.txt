(u"No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.", 9)
(u"'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall", 8)

(u'That.', 1)
(u'O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;', 9)
(u'railed at herself, that she should be so immodest', 9)
(u"to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I", 11)

(u'howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests', 10)
(u'he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall', 11)
(u'we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?', 10)
(u'Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with', 11)
(u'good counsel.', 2)
(u"Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.", 10)
(u'Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:', 10)

(u'could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see', 9)
(u'how much he is unworthy so good a lady.', 9)
(u'My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.', 8)
(u'If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never', 12)

(u'[Coming forward] This can be no trick: the', 8)

(u'seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!', 9)
(u'why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:', 11)
(u'they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive', 10)
(u'the love come from her; they say too that she will', 11)
(u'rather die than give any sign of affection. I did', 10)
(u'never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy', 10)
(u'are they that hear their detractions and can put', 9)

(u'so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving', 10)
(u'me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor', 12)

(u"she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in", 12)
(u'her.', 1)
(u'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.', 13)
(u'Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.', 8)
(u'I took no more pains for those thanks than you take', 11)
(u'pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would', 11)
(u'not have come.', 3)
(u'You take pleasure then in the message?', 7)
(u"Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's", 11)

(u'signior: fare you well.', 4)
(u"Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in", 12)
(u"to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took", 10)
(u'no more pains for those thanks than you took pains', 10)
(u"to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains", 11)
(u'that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do', 13)
(u'not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not', 13)
(u'love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.', 12)
(u'Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;', 7)
(u'There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice', 7)
(u'Proposing with the prince and Claudio:', 6)
(u'Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula', 9)
(u'Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse', 8)
(u"Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;", 9)
(u'And bid her steal into the pleached bower,', 8)
(u"Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,", 6)
(u'Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,', 7)
(u'Made proud by princes, that advance their pride', 8)
(u'Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,', 11)
(u'To listen our purpose. This is thy office;', 8)
(u'Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.', 9)
(u"I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.", 8)
(u'Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,', 6)
(u'As we do trace this alley up and down,', 9)
(u'Our talk must only be of Benedick.', 7)
(u'When I do name him, let it be thy part', 10)
(u'To praise him more than ever man did merit:', 9)
(u'My talk to thee must be how Benedick', 8)
(u'Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter', 9)
(u"Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,", 6)
(u'That only wounds by hearsay.', 5)
(u'Now begin;', 2)
(u'For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs', 8)
(u'Close by the ground, to hear our conference.', 8)
(u"The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish", 8)
(u'Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,', 8)
(u'And greedily devour the treacherous bait:', 6)
(u'So angle we for Beatrice; who even now', 8)
(u'Is couched in the woodbine coverture.', 6)
(u'Fear you not my part of the dialogue.', 8)
(u'Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing', 10)
(u'Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.', 10)
(u'No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;', 7)
(u'I know her spirits are as coy and wild', 9)
(u'As haggerds of the rock.', 5)
(u'But are you sure', 4)
(u'That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?', 6)
(u'So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.', 8)
(u'And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?', 10)
(u'They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;', 9)
(u'But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,', 8)
(u'To wish him wrestle with affection,', 6)
(u'And never to let Beatrice know of it.', 8)
(u'Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman', 8)
(u'Deserve as full as fortunate a bed', 7)
(u'As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?', 6)
(u'O god of love! I know he doth deserve', 9)
(u'As much as may be yielded to a man:', 9)
(u"But Nature never framed a woman's heart", 7)
(u'Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;', 7)
(u'Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,', 8)
(u'Misprising what they look on, and her wit', 8)
(u'Values itself so highly that to her', 7)
(u'All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,', 8)
(u'Nor take no shape nor project of affection,', 8)
(u'She is so self-endeared.', 4)
(u'Sure, I think so;', 4)
(u'And therefore certainly it were not good', 7)
(u'She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.', 10)
(u'Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,', 9)
(u'How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,', 8)
(u'But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,', 8)
(u'She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;', 9)
(u'If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,', 8)
(u'Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;', 9)
(u'If low, an agate very vilely cut;', 7)
(u'If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;', 9)
(u'If silent, why, a block moved with none.', 8)
(u'So turns she every man the wrong side out', 9)
(u'And never gives to truth and virtue that', 8)
(u'Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.', 5)
(u'Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.', 7)
(u'No, not to be so odd and from all fashions', 10)
(u'As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:', 6)
(u'But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,', 10)
(u'She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me', 11)
(u'Out of myself, press me to death with wit.', 9)
(u"Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,", 6)
(u'Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:', 6)
(u'It were a better death than die with mocks,', 9)
(u'Which is as bad as die with tickling.', 8)
(u'Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.', 10)
(u'No; rather I will go to Benedick', 7)
(u'And counsel him to fight against his passion.', 8)
(u"And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders", 7)
(u'To stain my cousin with: one doth not know', 9)
(u'How much an ill word may empoison liking.', 8)
(u'O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.', 9)
(u'She cannot be so much without true judgment--', 8)
(u'Having so swift and excellent a wit', 7)
(u'As she is prized to have--as to refuse', 8)
(u'So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.', 7)
(u'He is the only man of Italy.', 7)
(u'Always excepted my dear Claudio.', 5)
(u'I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,', 9)
(u'Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,', 5)
(u'For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,', 7)
(u'Goes foremost in report through Italy.', 6)
(u'Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.', 7)
(u'His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.', 9)
(u'When are you married, madam?', 5)
(u'Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:', 7)
(u"I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel", 9)
(u'Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.', 8)
(u"She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.", 10)
(u'If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:', 9)
(u'Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.', 8)
(u'[Coming forward]', 2)
(u'What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?', 10)
(u"Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?", 9)

(u'And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,', 8)
(u'Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:', 8)
(u'If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee', 9)
(u'To bind our loves up in a holy band;', 9)
(u'For others say thou dost deserve, and I', 8)
(u'Believe it better than reportingly.', 5)
(u'I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and', 10)
(u'then go I toward Arragon.', 5)
(u"I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll", 8)
(u'vouchsafe me.', 2)
(u'Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss', 12)
(u'of your marriage as to show a child his new coat', 11)
(u'and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold', 11)
(u'with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown', 9)
(u'of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all', 12)
